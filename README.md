# DCS World Schema

![CI Status](https://github.com/yolowingpixie/dcs-world-schema/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

YAML Representation of the DCS World Mission Scripting Environment's API Signature

## üìã Overview

This project provides a comprehensive YAML-based schema definition for the DCS World API. The goal is to create a complete schema that can be used by LSP servers to provide extremely strict and detailed linting for DCS World mission scripting in Lua.

## ‚ú® Features

- Complete API signature definitions in YAML format
- Type checking for DCS functions, methods, and properties
- Schema validation tools
- CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation
- JSON schema output compatible with language servers
- EmmyLua annotations export for Lua editor integration


### Future Features
Aspirationally, we would like to be able to provide, correct, valid packages for valdidating the DCS schema in the following languages natively:
- TypeScript definitions export for JavaScript/TypeScript development
- Go struct definitions for Go development
- Python type hints for Python development

The exporters for these languages exists in `/tools` at this time but a release process has not been formalized and the exports are not *great*.

The exporters can be used via `task build:golang`, `task build:python`, `task build:typscript` :

And they output as follows in `/dist`

- `dcs-world-api.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for JavaScript/TypeScript development
- `dcs-world-api.go` - Go struct definitions for Go applications
- `dcs_world_api.py` - Python type hints for Python development


## üöÄ Using Pre-built Releases

For most users, the easiest way to use this project is to download the pre-built releases:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/yolowingpixie/dcs-world-schema/releases) page
2. Download the latest release
3. Extract the files to your desired location

Each release includes:
- `dcs-world-api-schema.json` - JSON schema for the DCS World API
- `dcs-world-api-schema.yaml` - YAML schema for the DCS World API
- `dcs-world-api.lua` - EmmyLua annotations for Lua editor integration

### Using with Lua Editors

To use the EmmyLua annotations with your Lua editor:
1. Set up your editor to use EmmyLua annotations (VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)
2. Include the `dcs-world-api.lua` file in your project or configure your editor to reference it


## üõ†Ô∏è Building From Source

If you need to build from source or want to contribute to the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yolowingpixie/dcs-world-schema.git
   cd dcs-world-schema
   ```

2. Install Task (if not already installed):
   This project uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) to run commands. Installation instructions are available at [taskfile.dev/installation](https://taskfile.dev/installation/).

3. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   task setup
   ```

4. Generate all schema files and type definitions:
   ```bash
   task build
   ```

The generated files will be in the `dist/` directory.
